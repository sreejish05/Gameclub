# Gameclub: Tic Tac Toe and Hangman
This project features two engaging console games: Tic Tac Toe and Hangman. The program allows you to choose between these games and provides a simple, text-based interface to play them.

Games
Tic Tac Toe

The game checks for a winner or a draw after each move.
Play with another player and see who wins!
Hangman
A word guessing game where you guess a randomly selected word from a predefined list, with each word up to 5 letters long.
Dynamic memory allocation is used for managing the word and display string.
Try to guess the word within a limited number of attempts and see if you can figure it out!
